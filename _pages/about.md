Hello! I'm currently a graduate majoring in Transportations(Railway). My recent research field focuses on traffic assignment and computer science and Dr.Xu is my supervisor. Actually I plan to use this website as a life recorder.

If possible, I will post my latest academic progress in this website for record. It involves papers, programming, some thinking and so on.

Feel free to contact me at hejunfeng@my.swjtu.edu.cn.
